This week is QUIZ WEEK. I was very worried, but fortunately it worked out all well. What had be done for the week was the data project - making more graphs, finding the most significant data.

Something that i realised was that because my data had so much data, that there was 2 different files (1 for arrivals and 1 for departures), I found it incredibly hard to figure out what data to show and talk about. Also because I wanted to compare the arrivals to the departures, so I had to make double the amount of graphs.
