A run down of what each line does for the POkedex entry:

pokedex_entry = [] ---> empty list to store pokedmon data

for id in range(low, high): ---> starts a loops goes through each number from 'low' to 'high -1'.

url = f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}" ---> creates a url string for each pokemon ID by inserting 'id' into the URL.

r = requests.get(url) ---> sends a GET requests to te POkemon API using the URL.

if r.status_code == 200: ---> checks if the response code is successful (200 means successful)

the_json = r.json() ---> converts response form server into a Python dictionary.

pokedex_entry.append(the_json) ---> adds the JSON data of the POkemon to the pokedex_entry list.

tallest = none ---> sets tallest to none initially, to be replaces with the tallest pokemon found.

max_height = -1 ---> sets max_height initially to -1 as a comparing point for the heights.

for pokemon in pokedex_entry: ---> starts loops to go through each POkemon in the Pokedex_entry list.

if pokemon["height"] > max_height: ---> checks if current pokemon's height is greater than Max_height.

max_height = pokemon["height"]:---> updates the max_height to the current pokemon if its taller.

tallest = pokemon ---> sets 'tallest' to the current pokemon.

stats = { ---> creates a dictionary called stats, stroing the name, weight and height of the tallest Pokemon.
"name": tallest["name"],
"weight": tallest["weight"],
"height": tallest["height"],
}

I should actually fix this lol.
